Add support for Fragmention links to WordPress.

== Description ==

[Fragmention](http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html) is a method of linking to any text in a web page proposed by Kevin Marks. It uses a double hash syntax appended to a URL with the text following the two hash marks, using plus symbols to replace spaces. For example:

[http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html##I+suggest+using+a+double+hash](http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html##I+suggest+using+a+double+hash)

This removes the need for site developers to hard-code ID attributes into their site’s tags and gives users a completely flexible way to point to exactly the text they want to reference within a page.
