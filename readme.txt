Add support for Fragmention links to WordPress.

== Description ==

WP Fragmention is a plugin to add Jonathan Neal's [Fragmentions script](https://github.com/chapmanu/fragmentions) to WordPress.

[Fragmention](http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html##I+suggest+using+a+double+hash) is a method of linking to any text in a web page proposed by Kevin Marks. It uses a double hash syntax appended to a URL with the text following the two hash marks, using plus symbols to replace spaces. For example:

[http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html##I+suggest+using+a+double+hash](http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html##I+suggest+using+a+double+hash)

This removes the need for site developers to hard-code ID attributes into their siteâ€™s tags and gives users a completely flexible way to point to exactly the text they want to reference within a page.

1. Upload the `wp-fragmention` directory to your site's plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
